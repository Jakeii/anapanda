<h1>Member Growth</h1>
<p>Tunapanda Members want to grow in many dimensions. We always look for the win-win-win: improving the world, improving our communities, and improving ourselves. Thus, each of us does what we can to become more <strong>healthy, wealthy, wise, and connected</strong> while ensuring Tunapanda and the people we work with are better off than we were yesterday.

<h3>Wealthy</h3>

<p>
  <em>In short, the way to wealth, if you desire it, is as plain as the way to market. It depends chiefly on two words: industry and frugality. Waste neither time nor money, but make the best use of both.<br> - Benjamin Franklin</em>

<h3>Wise</h3>

<h3>Connected</h3>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>
  <em>This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap; the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. <br><br>
      I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the community, and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work, the more I live. Life is no ‘brief candle’ to me. It ia a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for a moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to the future generations. <br>
      - George Bernard Shaw</em>

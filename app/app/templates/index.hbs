        This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn
        out before you are thrown on the scrap heap; the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod
        of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. <br><br>        I
        am of the opinion that my life belongs to the community, and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever
        I can. I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work, the more I live. Life is no ‘brief candle’
        to me. It ia a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for a moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly
        as possible before handing it on to the future generations. <br> - George Bernard Shaw
